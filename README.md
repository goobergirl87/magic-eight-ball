The MAGIC EIGHT BALL. A toy that would never strike my parents as necessary, never left my mind and that now finally found a way into my life through coding. 

Will my cats live forever? Will I have pizza for dinner? Do I have to paint my flat when I move out? All important live questions answered with a single click. (When the ball says "ask me later again", there might be more) The perfect link for overthinkers. 

Besides fulfilling myself a childhood dream, The Magic Eight Ball gave me the opportunity to use a timeout function and CSS animation.
